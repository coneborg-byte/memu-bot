# 📋 Morpheus — Remaining Roadmap

Status: **Phase 1 Complete (The Nervous System)**
Next Focus: **Phase 2 (The Intelligence Layer)**

---

## 🏗️ Parked / High Priority
- [ ] **Personal CRM (Prompt #1)**: Build SQLite logic to track contacts, interactions, and "Last Seen" dates. Allow briefings on specific people.
- [ ] **Deep Knowledge Base (RAG)**: Optimise vector search. Feed it with your past project notes, library PDFs, and exported chat history.

## 🚀 Future Skills (From the Video)
- [ ] **Intelligence Briefings (Prompt #7)**: Automated web research on specific topics (AI trends, competitors) delivered weekly.
- [ ] **Content Engine (Prompt #8)**: Pipeline for capturing ideas, drafting outlines, and tracking production (if relevant to your workflow).
- [ ] **Financial Health (Prompt #9)**: Integration with earnings reports or portfolio tracking (needs data source).
- [ ] **Health & Food Journal (Prompt #10)**: Simple Telegram logging skill for nutrition/wellness tracking.

## 🔧 Refinement & Polish
- [ ] **Telegram Topics Migration**: Moving from a single chat to a "Group with Topics" for cleaner routing (Briefings, Alerts, Logs).
- [ ] **Ollama Model Swap**: Test Mistral or Llama3.2 to see if they follow the "Morpheus" persona better than 3.1:8b.
- [ ] **Gmail Multi-Account Support**: Extend bridges to handle more than the 'primary' token.
