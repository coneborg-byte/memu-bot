  Daily morning briefing. Use when: user asks for their daily briefing, morning summary,
  what's on today, or when the 7am cron fires. Pulls today's calendar events and recent
  emails from all linked accounts (Gmail and Yahoo), then delivers a single consolidated
  morning message to Nev.

# Daily Briefing Skill

## What This Does

Generates a single consolidated morning briefing covering:
1. Today's calendar events (with context)
2. Urgent/unread emails from all accounts (Gmail + Yahoo) in the last 24 hours
3. Pending items from the missions/ folder
4. A one-line weather note (if relevant)

## How to Use It

Run the briefing:
```
exec: python3 /root/.openclaw/skills/daily-briefing/briefing.py
```

## Output Format

Deliver as a single Telegram message. Structure:

```
🌅 Morning Briefing — [Day, Date]

📅 TODAY
• [time] — [event title]
• [time] — [event title]

📧 EMAILS (last 24h)
• [account] [sender]: [subject]
• [account] [sender]: [subject]

📋 PENDING
• [any missions/ items waiting]

---
[One sharp closing line. Optional weather if relevant.]
```

## Rules

- One message only. No back-and-forth.
- Keep it tight — this is a briefing, not an essay.
- If calendar is empty, say so in one line. Don't pad it.
- If no urgent emails, skip that section entirely.
- Deliver at 07:00 GMT via the cron job. Don't wait to be asked.
