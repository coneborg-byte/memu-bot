# HEARTBEAT.md

## Active Checks (rotate through these)

- Check Gmail for urgent unread messages (max 3 most recent)
- Check upcoming calendar events in the next 24 hours
- Review `missions/` folder for any pending tasks from Nev

## Rules

- Do NOT check between 23:00 and 08:00 GMT unless marked urgent.
- If nothing needs attention, reply `HEARTBEAT_OK`.
- Track last check times in `memory/heartbeat-state.json`.
- Batch checks together — don't make separate API calls for each.
