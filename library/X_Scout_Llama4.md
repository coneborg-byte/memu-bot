Topic: Latest news and sentiment on Meta's Llama 4 release.

## Executive Summary
Meta has launched Llama 4 (Scout, Maverick, and a preview of Behemoth). These are fully multimodal open-weight models designed to handle text, image, video, and audio. While Meta claims they are the "most advanced models yet," the release has been met with mixed real-world reviews and controversy regarding benchmarking transparency.

## Key Intelligence (The Alpha)
- **Modalities**: Fully multimodal (Text/Image/Video/Audio).
- **Benchmarking Drama**: Meta's VP Ahmad Al-Dahle defended the models against claims of "gaming" benchmarks or training on test sets.
- **Teacher Model**: Llama 4 Behemoth is being used to "teach" the smaller models and aims to compete with GPT-4.5 and Claude 3.7.
- **Hardware Optimization**: Llama 4 Scout is specifically optimized for AWS Graviton (Arm-based) infrastructure.
- **Negative Sentiment**: Some academic resignations and poor real-world testing results have been reported on X and Reddit, specifically regarding "logic" and "math" performance.
