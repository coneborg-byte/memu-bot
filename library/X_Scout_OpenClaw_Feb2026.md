OpenClaw is at a major turning point. The founder, Peter Steinberger, has moved to OpenAI to lead agent integration, while the project moves to an independent foundation. While community excitement is at an all-time high (the "Android moment" for AI agents), severe security vulnerabilities have been disclosed, leading to corporate bans at Meta and Microsoft.

- **Beta Improvements**: New beta features include Telegram message streaming and enhanced security protocols.
- **Revolutionizing Trading**: Significant sentiment on X suggesting OpenClaw will dominate automated trading.

## 🛑 SECURITY ADVISORY (CRITICAL)
